# StreetEasy Learning Project
StreetEasy is New York City’s leading real estate marketplace — from studios to high-rises, Brooklyn Heights to Harlem. The data is from Codecacademy with the StreetEasy Research team and it is a .csv file that contains a sample of 5,000 rentals listings in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens.

Find the correlations between several features and the rent, build/evaluate a MLR model, and the model can use to present interesting findings such as:

- “Does having a washer/dryer in unit increase the price of rent?”
- “How costly is living by a subway station in Brooklyn/Queens?”
- And most importantly, “Is a tenant over or underpaying?”
